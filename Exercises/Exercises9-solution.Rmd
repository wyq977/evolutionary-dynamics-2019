## Problem 1

### (a)

In the setting descriped in the script, only one type of occupied state ($S_1 = 1$) and no mutation was allowed during the process. Therefore, each site in the grid space would either be in $S_1$ occupied state or un-occupied. Following is the brief idea of the evolution process as per the script descrips.

The models described here is __bond-focussed__, explained below.

1. A candidate was randomly sampled from all the sites in the grid space that have been occupied ([code](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/EdenModel/blob/9c4524d1183cc1b0429f27dbdb98d5908dc1b587/EdenModelSim.R#L74)) with a probablity __proptional to the number of $S_0$ sites in its neibours__.
2. A unoccupied neibouring site ($S_0$) will switched to $S_1$.
  Skip if the neibouring sites were occupied ([code](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/EdenModel/blob/9c4524d1183cc1b0429f27dbdb98d5908dc1b587/EdenModelSim.R#L84))
3. Record the time for the proliferation event, which follows an exponetial distribution with the parameters $\lambda \propto \sum_{i,j} \text{neibours}_{i,j}$ ([code](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/EdenModel/blob/9c4524d1183cc1b0429f27dbdb98d5908dc1b587/EdenModelSim.R#L99))
4. Update the sites that has been occupied, the corresponding index list and the list of neibours. ([code](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/EdenModel/blob/9c4524d1183cc1b0429f27dbdb98d5908dc1b587/EdenModelSim.R#L110))

To make the proliferation rate __same__ across all cells of more than one $S_0$ in their neibours, the update rule needs to switch to __cell-focussed__ method described in the slides.

### (b)

A modification was made during the sampling stage. As indicated by the Q-Q plot below, the sampling in bond foucussed approach clearly derivate from the uniform distribution much more than the cell foucussed one. It should be noted the below Q-Q plot is re-sampling after the simulation (both cell focus and bond focus). On the other hand, if the grid space was pre-occupied with $S_1$ uniformly, two approaches do not differ in the re-sampling result as expected.

As shown in the simulation results below, the occupied grids in simulation of the cell focus one appears to be more uniform around the edge while the other possess rougher edge. This is due to the fact that the __bond-focussed__ method gives larges weight propotional to number of adjoining $S_0$ sites. Due to this bias in sampling, unoccupied sites around the corner in the grid space would have been `smoother` in the __cell-focussed__ one (as shown in Fig. 1). The effects of the sampling method can be clearly shown by the Q-Q plot below (Fig. 3)

```{r bond_sim, fig.cap="Simulation using bond focus method", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
source('ex9_1_EdenModelSim.R')
ITER = 1000
bond_based <- list()
cell_based <- list()

for(iter in 1:ITER) {
  candidate <- sample(1:num_has_space, 1, prob = unlist(how_many_spaces) * 
                        sapply(has_space, function(e) sites[e[1], e[2]]))
  bond_based[[iter]] <- candidate
}
```

```{r cell_sim, fig.cap="Simulation using cell focus method", fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
source('ex9_1_EdenModelSimCellBased.R')

for(iter in 1:ITER) {
  candidate <- sample(1:num_has_space, 1, prob = 
                        sapply(has_space, function(e) sites[e[1], e[2]]))
  cell_based[[iter]] <- candidate
}
```

```{r sampling, fig.cap="Sampling result using simulation", fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
x <- qunif(ppoints(ITER))
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
qqplot(x=x, y=sort(unlist(cell_based)), xlab = 'Uniform Distribution', ylab='Cell Based')
qqplot(x=x, y=sort(unlist(bond_based)), xlab = 'Uniform Distribution', ylab='Bond Based')
```

## Problem 2

### (a)

For a wild type to die off, the probablity w.r.t. time is:

\begin{align}
p = ï¼ˆN - n_i) \mu
\end{align}

Probablity that a dead individual is replaced by parents of its own deme:
\begin{align}
W_i^{+(local)}(\bm{n}) = (1-m) \dfrac{1+s}{N} n_i
\end{align}

Probablity that a dead individual is replaced by parents of other demes:
\begin{align}
W_i^{+(neibours)}(\bm{n}) = \dfrac{m}{2} \cdot \dfrac{\mu (1 + s) \cdot (n_{i+1})}{N} + \dfrac{m}{2} \cdot \dfrac{\mu (1 + s) \cdot (n_{i-1})}{N} 
\end{align}


Thus,

\begin{align}
W_i^{+}(\bm{n})
&= \dfrac{N - n_i}{N} \mu \Bigg(\dfrac{1+s}{N} n_i + \dfrac{m}{2} \cdot \dfrac{\mu (1 + s) \cdot (n_{i+1})}{N} + \dfrac{m}{2} \cdot \dfrac{\mu (1 + s) \cdot (n_{i-1})}{N} - m\dfrac{(1+s)n_i}{N} \Bigg) \\
&= \dfrac{\mu(1+s)(N-n_i)}{N}\Bigg(n_i + \frac{m}{2}(n_{i+1} + n_{i-1} -2n_{i}\Bigg) \\
&= \dfrac{\mu(1+s)(N-n_i)}{N}\Bigg(n_i + \frac{m}{2} n_i''\Bigg)
\end{align}

### (b)

\begin{align}
W_i^{+}(\bm{n}) - W_i^{-}(\bm{n})
&= \frac{\mu(1 + s)}{N} (N- n_i)[n_i + \frac{m}{2}n_i''] - \frac{\mu n_i}{N}[(N-n_i)- \frac{m}{2}n_i''] \\
&= \frac{\mu}{N}\Bigg[(1+s)(N-n_i)[n_i + \frac{m}{2}n_i''] - n_i(N-n_i)+n_i\frac{m}{2}n_i'' \Bigg] \\
&= \frac{\mu}{N}\Bigg[s(N-n_i)n_i + (1+s)(N-n_i)\frac{m}{2}n_i'' +n_i\frac{m}{2}n_i'' \Bigg] \\
&= \frac{\mu}{N}\Bigg[s(N-n_i)n_i + s(N-n_i)\frac{m}{2}n_i'' + N\frac{m}{2}n_i'' - \cancel{n_i\frac{m}{2}n_i''} + \cancel{n_i\frac{m}{2}n_i''} \Bigg] \\
&= \frac{\mu}{N}\Bigg[s(N-n_i)(n_i + \frac{m}{2}n_i'') + N\frac{m}{2}n_i'' \Bigg]
\end{align}

Therefore, $\od{\langle n_i \rangle}{t}$ can be written as:
\begin{align}
\od{\langle n_i \rangle}{t}
&= \langle W_i^{+}(\bm{n}) - W_i^{-}(\bm{n}) \rangle \\
&= \langle\frac{\mu}{N}\Bigg[s(N-n_i)(n_i + \frac{m}{2}n_i'') + N\frac{m}{2}n_i'' \Bigg] \rangle \\
&= \dfrac{\mu m }{2}\langle n_i'' \rangle + \frac{s\mu}{N}(N-\langle n_i \rangle)(\langle n_i \rangle + \frac{m}{2} \langle n_i'' \rangle)
\end{align}

### (c)

The differential equation above can be rewritten as:

\begin{align}
\mu s(1- \frac{1}{N}\langle n_i \rangle)(\frac{1}{N}\langle n_i \rangle) +
\dfrac{\mu m }{2}\langle n_i'' \rangle +
\mu s(1- \frac{1}{N}\langle n_i \rangle)(\frac{m}{2} \langle n_i'' \rangle)
\end{align}

As $\langle n_i'' \rangle$ can be interpreted as $\Big\langle (n_{i+1} - n_i) - (n_i-n_{i-1}) \Big\rangle$, which is the epected difference in $l\pd{u}{x}$, $l^2\pdsec{u}{x}$ (since $x = l\cdot i$ and change of variable)

Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as:
\begin{align}
\pd{u}{t}
&= \frac{\mu m}{2}l^2\pdsec{u}{x} + s\mu(1-u)(u + \frac{m}{2}l^2\pdsec{u}{x}) \\
&= \frac{\mu m}{2}(1 + s(1-u))l^2\pdsec{u}{x} + s\mu(1-u)u
\end{align}

### (d)

When $s=0$, the equation (4) resembles the 1-D heat equation, which has the anlytic solution and can be solved numberically.

PDE: $u_t = u_{xx}$, $0 < x < L$

IC: $u(x,0) = f(x)$, $0 < x < L$
In this case, it assigns a constant value $0$

BC: $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$, $t>0$
\begin{align}
u\left(0,t\right)+\left(0\cdot f\right) &=0, \\
\left(u\left(L,t\right)-1\right)+\left(0\cdot f\right) &=0\ldotp
\end{align}

Analytic solution:
\begin{align}
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin{n\pi x}e^{-n^2\pi^2 t}, \quad, B_m = 2\int_0^1 sin(m\pi x)f(x)dx
\end{align}

As shown in the figure below, the above diffusion equation failed to describe/approximate the spatial Moral model.
